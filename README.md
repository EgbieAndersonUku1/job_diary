# job_diary

As a person who works all over london different places sometimes each week. I sometimes find it hard to keep track of the different location that I have worked at. I often used Excel to keep track of my job outgoings including my pay. This has resulted in a huge Excel file that sometimes difficult to find what I am looking for.

This application when finished will keep a record of all the different locations that I have worked at along with daily pay and weekly, present and future places that I am going to work. Along with an easy search parameter that will enable me to find jobs by months, days, etc. It will also send me an email to remind when the day gets close to a place I am going to work at.
