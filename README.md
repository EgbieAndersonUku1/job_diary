# job_diary

Web Technology: Flask
DataBase: Mongodb
ORM : pymongo


As a person who works all over London different places sometimes each week. I sometimes find it hard to keep track of the different locations that I have worked at. I often used Excel to keep track of my job outgoings including my pay. This has resulted in a huge Excel file that sometimes difficult to navigate especially if looking for a specific month or job.

This web application when finished will keep a record of all the different locations that I have worked at along with daily pay and weekly, present and future places that I am going to work. Along with an easy search parameter that will enable me to find jobs by months, days, etc. It will also send me an email to remind when the day gets close to a place I am going to work at.
