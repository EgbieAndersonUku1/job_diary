As a person who works all over London different places sometimes each week. I sometimes find it hard to keep track of the different locations that I have worked at. I often used Excel to keep track of my job outgoings including my pay. This has resulted in a huge Excel file that sometimes difficult to navigate especially if looking for a specific month or job.

This web application when finished will keep a record of all the different locations that I have worked along with daily and weekly pay, present and future places that I am going to be working at, job title, description. Along with an easy search that will be built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap parameter that will give the application a nice feel and thus enable me to find jobs by months, days, hours, pay, etc. It will also send me an email to remind when the day gets close to a place I am going to work at.
