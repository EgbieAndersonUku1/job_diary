# job_diary

As person who works all over london, I sometimes find it hard to keep track of the different location that I have worked at.           
This application when finished will keep a record of all the different locations that I have worked along with how much daily pay
weekly pay as well as future places that I am going to work. It will also send me an email to remind when the day gets close to 
a place I am going to work at.
