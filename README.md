As a person who works all over London different places sometimes each week. I sometimes find it hard to keep track of the different locations that I have worked at. I often used Excel to keep track of my job outgoings including my pay. This has resulted in a huge Excel file that sometimes difficult to navigate especially if looking for a specific month or job.

This is my primary reason for creating this web application and when finished and will keep a record of all the different locations that I have worked along with the daily and weekly pay, present and future places that I am going to be working at, job title, description, etc and anything I could not acheive in Excel.

Along with an easy web interface, search parameter that will all be built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Giving the application a nice look and feel and thus enable me to query jobs by either months, days, hours, pay, dates, etc. 

It will also send me an email to remind when the day gets close to a place I am going to work at.
